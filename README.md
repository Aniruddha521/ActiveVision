Title: ActiveVision: a data and model portal for the study of goal-directed vision

Project Description: Salience map research in computer vision has extensively examined where human observers look in images and videos during free viewing. Despite cognitive psychology recognizing the role of behavioral goals for over 50 years, integrating task dependence into quantitative models and large open datasets is a recent development. This project aims to create an open portal that consolidates existing machine learning/AI models and eye-tracking datasets related to goal-directed vision (e.g., visual search) while providing tools for model testing and validation. A key focus will be on multimodal AI, particularly language-vision integration. Additionally, this platform will serve as a prototype for similar data+model initiatives on public hardware platforms.
